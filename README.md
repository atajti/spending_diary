# Spending diary

I made a small Google questionary whare I can log all my spendings. I want to build on this with different functions.

## Spending alert

I have a budget for each category, and I would like to get an alert if I overshoot it.

## Visualization

I'd like to make an obvious-to-read graph about my current and past spendings.
